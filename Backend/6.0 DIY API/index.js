//1. GET a random joke
// app.get comes from express, first argument is the endpoint, second is the callback function- what should happen when the request comes through.
// in this case i want to tap into the request and response objects, to get hold of a random number (between 0-1), and multiply it by the length of the jokes array. then Math.floor round it down to the nearest integer.
// This random joke i send back to the client as a response with res.json, a way to convert the data here as a json object.
app.get("/random", (req, res) => {
  const randomJoke= Mathh.floor (Math.random() * jokes.length);
  res.json (jokes[randomJoke]);
});


//2. GET a specific joke
app.get("/jokes/:id", (req, res) => {
  const id = parseInt (req.params.id);    // hw to access any of the URL parameters in express
  // array.find
  // === checks for value and type, so if i have a string and a number, it will not be equal
  const foundJoke = jokes.find ( (joke) => joke.id === id );
  res.json (foundJoke);
});


//3. GET a jokes by filtering on the joke type
app.get("/filter", (req, res) => {
  const type = req.params.type; 
  // array.filter (return an array)
  const filteredActivities = jokes.filter ( (joke) => jokes.type === type );
  res.json (filteredActivities);
});
// in postman i run a GET request to http://localhost:3000/filter?type=Math, and get back all the jokes with the type Math.


// in postman i run a POST request to http://localhost:3000/jokes.

//4. POST a new joke
app.post("/jokes", (req, res) => {
  const newJoke = {
    id: jokes.length + 1,
    jokeText: req.body.jokeText,

  const replacementJoke = {
    id: id,
    jokeText: req.body.jokeText,
    jokeType: req.body.jokeType,
  }
  // array.index - index is the position of the joke (object) in the array
const searchedIndex = jokes.findIndex ((joke) => jokes.id === id );
  res.json (searchedIndex);
});



//6. PATCH a joke (update)
app.patch ("/jokes/:id", (req, res) => {
const id = parseInt (req.params.id);
const existingJoke = jokes.find ( (joke) => joke.id === id );
const updatedJoke = {
  id:id,
  jokeText: req.body.jokeText || existingJoke.jokeText,
  jokeType: req.body.jokeType || existingJoke.jokeType,
};
// now i need to replace the existing joke with the updated joke and send it back to the client
const searchedIndex = jokes.findIndex ((joke) => jokes.id === id );
jokes [searchedIndex] = updatedJoke;
res.json (updatedJoke);
});



//7. DELETE Specific joke
app.delete("/jokes/:id", (req, res) => {
  const id = parseInt (req.params.id);
  const  searchedIndex = jokes.findIndex ((joke) => jokes.id === id );
  // remove 1 element- searchedIndex (position of the joke in the array)
  jokes.splice (searchedIndex, 1);

});


//8. DELETE All jokes
//the user need to enter the value of masterKey to delete all jokes
app.get("/all", (req, res) => {
const userKey = req.body.userKey;
if (userKey === masterKey) {
  jokes = [];
  res.send("All jokes have been deleted.");
} else {
  res.status(404).json({ error: "You are not authorized to delete all jokes." });
}
});
